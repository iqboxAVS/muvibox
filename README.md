VersionCode1.txt & VersionLocation1.txt are used with the New Updater created in 2017
All versions of the Updater use the same location.txt and option.txt.
location1.txt is the location of .spmc builds. location.txt is standard .kodi builds.
The only differences are within the updating of the actual app.
